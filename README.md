In this project, you will learn to create navigation action menus and draggable features. When you click on the plus icon at the top of the screen, five navigation buttons will appear with beautiful animation and align in a half-circular shape. You can also make it a full circular shape by adding navigation buttons. You can drag this navigation action menu vertically.

This Draggable Navigation Menu is made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I hope you will be delighted to take on this project. All the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code and video tutorial links for this project are given below.
